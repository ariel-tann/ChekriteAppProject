# ChekriteAppProject

<h2>WHAT IS CHECKRITE APP?</h2> 
ChekRite App is an app that allow users to create checklists for various inspections. It replaces paper-based checklists so that data can be captured in real-time and easily retrieved when needed.

<h2>GOAL OF THIS PROJECT</h2>
The ChekRite app was first available on iOS. In order to reach a wider customer base, an Android version was created using React Native. However,
due to time constraints and poor planning, the Android version was poorly built and difficult to maintain. Therefore, ChekRite would like a new
Android version built using Native Android that closely follows the look and feel of the iOS version. 

<h2>MY ROLE IN THIS PROJECT</H2>
I was the group leader for this project. I handled the planning of each sprint and the delegation of tasks to each member. I made sure that the project stayed on track and made changes to future sprints to accomodate unforeseen problems that arose. I presented our deliverables weekly to the stakeholders and project manager.

<h2>MY CONTRIBUTION</h2>
<h3>Keyboard</h3>
A unique feature of ChekRite App is that it uses a dedicated keyboard for typing rather than using the mobile phone's keyboard. This is to make the process of completing a checklist easier. My task was to create a keyboard that looked and feel like the keyboard used in the iOS version. 

<h3>NewCheck</h3>
This activity allow users to search for different checklists through three different methods: search, see and select. These three methods can each be selected on the same screen through a tab at the top of the screen. For the search method, the user will type the name of the vehicle that they want to inspect, and the results are shown in real-time as the user inputs more data. The see method was not within the scope of the project, hence it was left as a blank screen. The select method allows users to find the checklist through a filtering. 

<h3>UI</h3>
At the start of the project, a feedback that we got was that the UI does not closely resemble the iOS version. Therefore, my task was to ensure that the UI always matched the iOS version throughout each deliverable.

<h2>DISCLAIMER</h2>
This app no longer runs because the API provided by ChekRite for this project does not exist due to the completion of the unit.
